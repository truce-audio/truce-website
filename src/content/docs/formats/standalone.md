# Standalone

A standalone binary mode of your plugin: drives the DSP against your
OS audio driver directly and opens your plugin's editor in its own
window. Not a plugin format a DAW loads — a way to run the same crate
as an app.

## Status

Shipped on all three platforms. Every documented example ships a
standalone binary.

| Platform | Audio backend | GUI |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| macOS | CoreAudio (via cpal) | ✅ |
| Windows | WASAPI (via cpal) | ✅ |
| Linux | ALSA or PipeWire-JACK (via cpal) | ✅ (X11; Wayland via XWayland) |

## Enable

Plugins scaffolded with `cargo truce new` (or `new --workspace`) ship
the standalone host enabled out of the box — `Cargo.toml` lists
`standalone` in `default = [...]` and `src/main.rs` is pre-written.
If you opted out at scaffold time with `--no-standalone`, or you're
adding standalone to an existing crate, do the two mechanical
additions below. No `lib.rs` edits.

**`Cargo.toml`:**

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "<crate_name>-standalone"
path = "src/main.rs"
required-features = ["standalone"]

[features]
standalone = ["dep:truce-standalone"]

[dependencies]
truce-standalone = { workspace = true, features = ["gui"], optional = true }
```

`<crate_name>` is your crate's `[package].name` — the convention
(e.g. `truce-example-gain` → `truce-example-gain-standalone`) is what
the scaffolder emits. `cargo truce run` reads your `Cargo.toml` and
picks the `[[bin]]` entry whose `required-features` contains
`"standalone"`, so the actual name can be anything; the convention just
keeps the cargo-built path predictable.

**`src/main.rs`:**

```rust
use my_plugin::Plugin;

fn main() {
    truce_standalone::run::<Plugin>();
}
```

## Run

```sh
cargo truce run -p <crate>             # build + stage + launch
cargo truce run -p <crate> -- --help   # pass flags through to the binary
```

`cargo truce run` handles feature + bin selection and stages the
binary into `target/bundles/{Plugin}.standalone/` alongside every
other truce-produced artifact.

## CLI flags

```
<plugin>-standalone [OPTIONS]

  --headless               Run audio only; no window
  --list-devices           List audio output + input devices and exit
  --list-midi              List MIDI input devices and exit
  --output <name>          Audio output device (substring match)
  --input <name>           Audio input device (for effect plugins)
  --input-enabled <on|off> Enable mic input at launch (default: off).
                           Press `I` in the window to toggle live.
  --output-enabled <on|off> Enable speaker output at launch (default: on).
                           Toggle live from the Plugin menu (Cmd+O / Ctrl+O).
  --sample-rate <hz>       e.g. 44100, 48000, 96000
  --buffer <frames>        Audio buffer size
  --midi-input <name>      MIDI input device (substring match).
                           Repeatable — the Nth flag feeds the
                           plugin's Nth MIDI input port
  --bpm <n>                Transport BPM (default 120)
  --state <path>           Load a state file on launch (a .trucepreset
                           preset or a saved state blob)
  --preset <name|uri>      Load a library preset on launch, by name
                           (or its preset uri)
  --list-presets           List the plugin's presets and exit
  -h, --help               Show this message
```

### `playback` feature: WAV in / WAV out

The optional `playback` feature on `truce-standalone` adds three
flags for piping `.wav` files in and out of the plugin without an
audio interface — useful for snapshot regression tests, batch
rendering, and CI runs on headless build agents. Enable from your
plugin crate with:

```toml
[features]
standalone-playback = ["standalone", "truce-standalone/playback"]
```

…then build the binary with `--features standalone-playback`.

```
  --input-file <path>      Decode <path>.wav and feed it into the
                           plugin's input bus. One-shot — plays
                           once, then the file channel goes silent.
                           Mic + file sum when both are enabled.
                           Linear-interp resample if the file's SR
                           differs from the device's; channel-count
                           mismatches are soft-warned and adapted.
  --output-file <path>     Capture the plugin's output bus to
                           <path>.wav (32-bit float, pre-mute).
                           Implies --headless. Real-time by default
                           (cpal still drives the audio thread);
                           pair with --no-playback for offline.
  --no-playback            Bypass cpal entirely; render as fast as
                           the CPU allows. Requires both
                           --input-file and --output-file
                           (otherwise ignored with a warn).
```

Common shapes:

```sh
# Real-time capture: hear it while it records.
truce-example-gain-standalone --input-file in.wav --output-file out.wav

# Offline render — sub-real-time, no audio device touched.
# This is the CI / batch recipe.
truce-example-gain-standalone --no-playback --input-file in.wav --output-file out.wav
```

In offline mode the runner inherits the input WAV's sample rate
and channel count by default (override with `--sample-rate` if
needed); output WAV is always 32-bit float at the resolved SR.
Mute (`--output-enabled off`) silences the speakers but **does
not** affect what `--output-file` captures — bounce-to-disk
behaviour matches what every DAW does.

## Presets

The standalone host browses and saves your plugin's preset library
through a native **Presets** menu (macOS and Windows):

- **Load** — pick a preset. The list also shows your own user presets
  and any installed packs, deduped by identity.
- **Previous / Next** — step through the list to audition sounds.
- **Save** — update the preset you're editing in place. With a
  factory preset loaded (or nothing) there's nothing of yours to
  overwrite, so Save is grayed and points you at Save As — you can't
  clobber a stock sound by accident. The menu label shows the file
  you'd write, e.g. `Save Preset (Glass.trucepreset)`.
- **Save As…** — name a new preset. macOS / Windows open a native
  save panel (which confirms overwrites); the new preset is selected
  once saved.

Presets you save show up in the menu the next time you open it — no
relaunch — and land in the same per-OS user location your DAW reads,
so a sound you dial in here is immediately available in your projects.

Keyboard shortcuts work on every platform, and are the whole preset
interface on Linux (the X11 standalone has no menu bar): **Cmd-S /
Ctrl-S** to Save, **Cmd-Shift-S / Ctrl-Shift-S** to Save As. You can
also load a sound straight from the command line with
`--preset <name>`, or list what's available with `--list-presets`.

See the [presets guide](../guide/presets.md) for authoring libraries.

## In-window hotkeys

- **SPACE** — toggle transport play / stop
- **Cmd-S / Ctrl-S** — save the current preset; **Cmd-Shift-S /
  Ctrl-Shift-S** — Save As (see Presets above)
- **I** — toggle mic input (effect plugins only). First press on
  macOS triggers the system permission prompt.
- **Cmd-O / Ctrl-O** — toggle audio output (mute / unmute). Plugin
  keeps processing — meters, transport, MIDI all still tick — only
  the speaker output is zeroed.
- **Z / X** — shift QWERTY-MIDI octave down / up
- **A S D F G H J K L ;** — white keys (C D E F G A B C D E)
- **W E T Y U O P** — black keys

The QWERTY-to-MIDI mapping is keyed on physical key positions, so
AZERTY / Dvorak / etc. map to the same piano keys.

## Settings precedence

Each setting resolves first-match-wins:

1. CLI flag (`--output "…"`)
2. Environment variable (`TRUCE_STANDALONE_OUTPUT="…"`)
3. Plugin-author defaults via `run_with::<P>(Defaults { … })`
4. Compiled runtime default (input off, output on, cpal-picked
   devices)

Plugin authors can pin `input_enabled` / `output_enabled` defaults
in code without giving up CLI / env override:

```rust
use truce_standalone::{run_with, Defaults};

fn main() {
    run_with::<my_plugin::Plugin>(Defaults {
        input_enabled: Some(true),  // effect plugin wants mic on by default
        ..Defaults::default()
    });
}
```

Other settings (device names, sample rate, buffer size, MIDI
input, BPM, state path) are intentionally CLI/env-only — those
are per-machine concerns the plugin author shouldn't be pinning
in code.

## MIDI

`midir`-based input with substring matching on port names. A
background thread polls at 1 Hz for hot-plug; disconnect falls back
to QWERTY, reconnect is silent.

Supported: MIDI 1.0 note on / off (velocity-0 note-on decodes as
note-off), CC, pitch bend, channel pressure. No sysex, no MPE, no
MIDI 2.0.

## Transport

Minimal — sufficient for LFOs, tempo-synced delays, arpeggiators. Not
a DAW timeline.

- `tempo`: set via `--bpm` or config; default 120
- `playing`: SPACE toggles; default stopped
- `position_beats`: advances while playing

Atomic-backed — UI-thread toggles don't block the audio thread.

## Integration tests

The same engine that backs `--no-playback` also drives in-process
audio tests via [`truce_test::PluginDriver`](../guide/audio-testing.md).
No cpal, no window, no devices — instantiate the plugin, feed
scripted audio + MIDI for a fixed duration, capture the output:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use truce_test::{assertions, driver};

let result = driver!(Plugin)
    .sample_rate(48_000.0)
    .duration(Duration::from_secs(3))
    .script(|s| {
        s.note_on(60, 0.8);
        s.wait_ms(100);
        s.note_off(60);
    })
    .run();

assertions::assert_no_nans(&result);
assertions::assert_nonzero(&result);
assertions::assert_silence_after(&result, Duration::from_millis(2_500));
```

Opt in from the plugin crate:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
truce-test = { workspace = true }
```

Good for tail-silence / release-decay tests, sustained-load stability,
clipping guards, and MIDI-recorded regression tests. See
[`../guide/audio-testing`](../guide/audio-testing.md) for
the full builder surface — input shapes, state-file loading,
per-block meters, output-event capture.

## Distribution

`cargo truce package` ships the standalone alongside the plug-in formats —
no extra flag, no separate build step.

On **macOS** the standalone and AU v3 are the **same app**: when AU v3 is
also packaged, you get one `/Applications/{Name}.app` that is both the AU v3
container the DAW loads and the playable standalone, offered in the `.pkg`
as a single **"AU3 + Standalone"** choice. (With no AU v3 build the
standalone ships as its own `.app`.) See
[Audio Unit › AU v3 and the standalone are one app](au.md#au-v3-and-the-standalone-are-one-app).

On **Windows** the standalone `.exe` ships in the installer; on **Linux**
it ships in the `.tar.gz` (AppImage is still on the backlog).

## Limitations

- **Wayland** unparented top-level windows still lag X11; XWayland is
  the validated path.
- **No parameter automation record / replay**.
- **The MIDI device menu shows at most sixteen plugin MIDI input
  ports** (macOS and Windows). Deeper multi-port plugins route their
  remaining ports with the repeatable `--midi-input` flag, which has
  no cap.
- **State files have no migration layer**: bumping `STATE_VERSION`
  invalidates saved `.state` files; the plugin logs a clear error.
