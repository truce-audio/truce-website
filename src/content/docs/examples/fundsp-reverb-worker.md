# Fundsp Reverb (Worker variant)

<img src="/screenshots/examples/fundsp-reverb-worker.png" class="screenshot-hero" width="208" height="182" alt="fundsp-reverb-worker plugin">

Stereo plate reverb wired through a
[`fundsp`](https://github.com/SamiPerttu/fundsp) audio graph. The
point of this example is the integration shape — how to hold a
fundsp graph inside a truce plugin and keep it alloc-free on the
audio thread.

This is the **production-pattern** variant: graph rebuilds happen
on a dedicated worker thread and the audio thread picks them up
via a lock-free swap. For the simpler inline-rebuild version
(rt-unsafe but easier to read top-to-bottom), see
[fundsp-reverb-simple](./fundsp-reverb-simple). Both crates share
the same topology, params, and signal flow.

The [fundsp integration guide](../guide/fundsp) walks through both
variants in depth.

## Integration patterns

- **Graph built off the audio thread.** `reset()` builds the
  initial graph synchronously (host calls it off the audio path);
  subsequent rebuilds run on a dedicated worker thread.
  `process()` never allocates, never calls `Box::new`, never calls
  `graph.allocate()`, and never drops a `Box<dyn AudioUnit>`.
- **Lock-free worker handoff.** Three
  `crossbeam_queue::ArrayQueue`s shuttle work between the audio
  thread and the rebuild worker: `requests` (audio → worker,
  latest target wins via `force_push`), `ready` (worker → audio,
  the freshly-built graph), `discard` (audio → worker, so the old
  graph is dropped off-thread). The worker `park`s when idle and
  the audio thread `unpark`s it on a new request.
- **Worker rebuilds carry their SR.** Each ready graph is tagged
  with the sample rate it was built for. If `reset()` swaps in a
  new SR while a worker rebuild is in flight, the audio thread
  sees the SR mismatch and reroutes the stale graph to the
  discard queue rather than swapping it in.
- **Params reach the graph through `fundsp::Shared` atomics.**
  `var(&shared)` reads them per sample; the closure inside
  `for_each_frame` writes the smoothed truce-side value into the
  cell on the same tick (sample-accurate automation).
- **`Box<dyn AudioUnit>`** for the field type. The concrete
  `An<…>` is hundreds of chars of nested generics; the vtable
  cost is one indirection per block.
- **`AudioBuffer::for_each_frame::<2, _>`** transposes truce's
  per-channel layout into stack-allocated frames so fundsp's
  `tick(in, out)` callback can be called directly. No scratch
  field.
- **Reverb time triggers a worker rebuild** when the param drifts
  ≥ 5% — `reverb_stereo`'s `time` argument is baked at
  construction. The audio thread reads the raw `param.value()`
  (not the smoothed `.read()`) so a knob ramp doesn't trip the
  threshold every block while the smoother crawls across it.

## Gotchas

- **Filter input order is positional and unchecked.** `highpass()`
  / `lowpass()` take `(signal, cutoff, Q)`. Every connection is
  `f32`, so `(cutoff | Q | signal) >> highpass()` compiles fine
  and silently feeds the filter cutoff in as audio — the resulting
  filter blows up the reverb FDN to peak ~7000 within a second.
  Test against constant input + `assert_peak_below`.
- **Type-level channels.** `dry * mix` fails to compile when `dry`
  is stereo and `mix` is a 1-channel `Shared` read; broadcast the
  mix to stereo manually with `var(&mix) | var(&mix)`. fundsp's
  payoff (graph composition with `>>` / `|` / `&`) costs this
  kind of explicit plumbing.
